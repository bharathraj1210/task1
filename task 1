HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it. In contrast, HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.



In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.

Creating Objects in JavaScript:
By object literal
By creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword)
By object literal:
The syntax of creating object using object literal is given below:


Property and value is separated by colon(:).

Example:




When we want to communicate between devices we need unique address to identify devices in a network.

In different situation we may need different types of addresses, there are several reasons for that.

IPv4

IPv4 is a 32 bit address represented in dotted decimal notationExample10.45.23.30172.16.10.100192.168.23.67each decimal number is separated by a dot hence its called dotted decimal notation

IPv6

IPv6 was introduced in 1998 as an alternate addressing scheme to IPv4. IPv6 is 128 bit address which is represented in colon hexadecimal notationExample2001:1893:0021:ae02:bef0:53c8:201b:0173here each block is separated by : hence colon hexadecimal notation.


MAC address

A MAC address is a hardware address assigned to network interface card by the manufacturer of the hardware & its a permanent addressif your computer has multiple network ports , it will have unique MAC address for each port. MAC address is represented in 12 digit hexadecimal number Example a0:14:6b:02:48:fd

Port Numbers

A Port address or port number is an unique number to identify transport layer service.

there are 65536 ports available

out of which up to port number 1023 are called as server ports or well Known port numbers

1024 onwards it's called as client port numbers or unknown port numbers.

These ports are not physical ports they are logical ports.
